## 7. Content Removal Strategy

### Content to REMOVE (Not migrating):

**From IntelligentApplications:**
- ❌ Specific "Essential Web" pricing tier ($4,997) - too low for transformation scope
- ❌ "Your Business, Anytime, Anywhere" subtitle - too generic

**From DigitalTransformation:**
- ❌ "Rapid Migration Timeline" proof item (6-9 months) - redundant with process section
- ❌ "Zero Downtime" proof item - incorporate into process description instead

---

## 8. SEO Content Preservation

### Meta Tags (NEW):
```html
<title>Digital Solutions & Modernization | EthosPrompt Australia</title>
<meta name="description" content="Transform your business with modern digital solutions. 60% cost reduction, 3x performance improvement. WordPress migration, web & mobile development for Australian SMEs." />
<meta name="keywords" content="digital transformation, WordPress migration, React development, web development Australia, mobile app development, legacy system modernization, digital solutions Sydney, Melbourne web development" />
```

### Canonical URL:
```
https://react-app-000730.web.app/services/digital-solutions
```

### Redirects (301):
```
/services/intelligent-applications → /services/digital-solutions
/services/digital-transformation → /services/digital-solutions
```
